I hold a postgraduate degree in Software Engineering from PUC Minas, where I am also specializing in Cybersecurity and Data Governance. With a background in Information Systems, I have diverse experience in software development and currently work as a fullstack developer at Previsiown. In my role, I create new features, maintain existing code, and assist my colleagues with their technical challenges.

I am a generalist in software development, with a solid foundation in various technologies and a proven ability to quickly learn new tools and methodologies. I possess skills in several technologies, including PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, React, C#, .NET, Blazor, and Docker, which enable me to tackle complex challenges and deliver high-impact solutions.
