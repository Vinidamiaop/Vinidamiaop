I am a technology enthusiast who loves studying, writing code, and seeing everything work as intended.

I hold a postgraduate degree in Software Engineering from PUC Minas (Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais) and have started another postgraduate program in Cybersecurity and Data Governance, also at PUC. I have also graduated in Information Systems from Estácio de Sá and earned a bachelor's degree in Advertising and Marketing from UniFOA. My diverse academic background, combined with my passion for innovation and continuous learning, helps me easily adapt to new technologies and work environments.
