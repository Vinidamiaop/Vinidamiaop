I am a technology enthusiast who thoroughly enjoys studying, writing code, and seeing everything work as intended.

I am currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Software Engineering at PUC Minas (Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais), studying Information Systems at Estácio de Sá, and hold a bachelor's degree in Advertising and Marketing from UniFOA.
My academic background, combined with my passion for innovation and continuous learning, allows me to easily adapt to new technologies and work environments.
